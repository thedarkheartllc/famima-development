Perfect â€” hereâ€™s a README.md for your Phase 1 photo grid. This is the dead-simple version: drop photos into /public/photos, deploy to Vercel, and youâ€™ve got your own gallery tonight.

# Famima Grid (Phase 1)

A super-minimal photo gallery for family & friends.  
No accounts, no likes, no feeds â€” just a 3-column responsive grid of your photos.

---

## ðŸš€ How It Works

- Put all your images inside `/public/photos/`.
- Next.js automatically serves them as static files.
- The gallery page dynamically loads and displays them in a simple 3-column grid.
- Deploy to [Vercel](https://vercel.com) and connect your domain.

## ðŸ›  Setup

1. **Create project**

   ```bash
   npx create-next-app@latest famima-grid
   cd famima-grid
   npm install tailwindcss
   npx tailwindcss init -p

   	2.	Enable Tailwind
   Add to tailwind.config.js:
   ```

content: [
"./app/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}",
"./components/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}",
],

Add to globals.css:

@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;

    3.	Add photos
    â€¢	Create a folder: /public/photos/
    â€¢	Drop in your .jpg or .png files.
    â€¢	Keep filenames simple (e.g., beach.jpg, paris.png).
    4.	Create gallery page

app/page.tsx:

import fs from "fs";
import path from "path";
import Image from "next/image";

export default function Gallery() {
const photosDir = path.join(process.cwd(), "public/photos");
const files = fs.readdirSync(photosDir);

return (
<main className="bg-black min-h-screen p-4">
<div className="grid grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2 md:grid-cols-3 gap-4">
{files.map((file) => (
<div key={file} className="relative w-full h-80">
<Image
src={`/photos/${file}`}
alt={file}
fill
className="object-cover rounded"
/>
</div>
))}
</div>
</main>
);
}

    5.	Run locally

npm run dev

Open http://localhost:3000 â€” you should see your grid.

    6.	Deploy to Vercel
    â€¢	Push to GitHub.
    â€¢	Import repo in Vercel.
    â€¢	Done ðŸŽ‰

ðŸ’¡ Tips
â€¢ For speed, compress photos first (aim for 200â€“400 KB each).
â€¢ Works fine with 50â€“100 photos. Thousands will slow deploys.
â€¢ Add new photos â†’ push commit â†’ redeploy.

â¸»

ðŸ“– Future (Phase 2)
â€¢ External storage (Firebase, Supabase, or S3).
â€¢ Upload page (no need to redeploy).
â€¢ Family access control (private link or password).

â¸»

ðŸ“– License

Personal project â€” do whatever you want.

âš¡ This is literally the **one-page gallery** version â€” you can deploy it tonight and have your own family photo wall live.

Want me to also give you a **ready-to-copy `globals.css` and Tailwind config** so you donâ€™t have to tweak anything before it works?
