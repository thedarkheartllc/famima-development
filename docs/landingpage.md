## 🌱 Ethos

**Privacy. Security. Simplicity.**  
Famima is not another social media app. It’s a digital home for the people who matter most.  

- No doomscrolling  
- No advertisements  
- No NSFW  
- Not designed to make you addicted  

Just you.  
Your family.  
Your peace of mind.

## 🖤 What Makes Famima Different

- **Safe by design** — No noise, no politics, no rage baiting, no racism.  
- **Private by default** — Your photos stay with your family and friends, not with advertisers.  
- **Simple to use** — Upload, share, and view in a clean 3-column grid. That’s it.  
- **Respectful of your time** — Famima won’t beg for attention. Open it when you want, close it when you’re done.

Famima is built for something else: **connection without distraction.**  

- Share travel photos with grandparents.  
- Post your kids’ milestones without worry.  
- Keep family memories in one safe place.
